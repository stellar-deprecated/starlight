## Summary

This protocol defines the Stellar transactions that two participants use to
open and close a payment channel.

## Dependencies

This protocol is dependent on the not-yet-impemented [CAP-21], and is based
on the two-way payment channel protocol defined in that CAP's rationale.

This protocol is also dependent on [CAP-23], that added claimable balances
ledger entries, and [CAP-33], that added sponsorship to accounts.

## Motivation

Stellar account holders who frequently transact with each other, but do not
trust each other, are limited to performing all their transactions on-chain
to get the benefits of the network enforcing transaction finality.  The
network is fast, but not as fast as two parties forming an agreement directly
with each other.  For high-frequency transactors it would be beneficial if
there was a simple method on Stellar to allow two parties to escrow funds
into an account that is controlled by both parties, where agreements can be
formed and guaranteed to be executable and contested on-chain.  [CAP-21],
[CAP-23], and [CAP-33] introduce new functionality to the Stellar protocol
that make it easier to do this.

## Abstract

This protocol defines the Stellar transactions that two participants use to
open and close a payment channel by using an escrow account to holds funds, a
reserve account to hold native asset to pay for new ledger entries, and
claimable balances as an uninterruptable method for final disbursement.

A payment channel has two participants, an initiator I and a responder R.

The protocol assumes some _observation period_, O, such that both parties are
guaranteed to be able to observe the blockchain state and submit transactions
within any period of length O.

The payment channel consists of a 2-of-2 multisig escrow account E, and a
series of transaction sets that contain _declaration_ and _closing_
transactions on E signed by both participants.  The closing transaction
defines the final state of the channel that creates claimable balances for R
and returns control of E to I.  Each generation of declaration and closing
transaction sets in the series are an agreement on a new final state for the
channel.

Participants use each iteration of declaration and closing transaction sets to
agree, and continuously re-agree, on a new final states for the channel. They
may choose to modify their agreement based on individual payments to one
another, or on some other basis such as to perform net settlement.

For example, if the channel initial state is $30 of which $10 belongs to I and
$20 belongs to R, the first closing transaction will disburse $10 to I and $20
to R. If I makes a payment of $2 to R, then I and R agree on a new closing
transaction that will disburse $8 to I and $22 to R.

The payment channel also uses a second 2-of-2 multisig reserve account V, to
sponsor the claimable balances ledger entries that are created at channel
close, and that disburse funds to R.

## Specification

### Participants

A payment channel has two participants:

- I, the _initiator_, who proposes the payment channel, performs the first
setup step, and will be able to make deposits to the payment channel without
coordination.  I creates escrow account E and receives disbursement through
regaining control of E at channel close.

- R, the _responder_, who joins the payment channel, and receives disbursement
through claimable balances at channel close.

### Observation Period

A payment channel defines an observation period O within which all
participants are guaranteed to be able to observe the blockchain state and
submit transactions in response to changing state.

The participants agree on the period O at channel open.

The observation period is defined both as a duration in time, and a count of
ledgers. The observation period has passed if both the duration and ledger count
have been exceeded. These two properties together are referred to as O
throughout the protocol.

The participants may agree to change the period O at anytime by following the
[Change the Observation Period](#Change-the-Observation-Period) process.

### Accounts

The payment channel utilizes two Stellar accounts that are both 2-of-2
multisig accounts while the channel is open:

- E, the _escrow account_, that holds the assets that both participants have
contributed to the channel and that will be distributed to the participants
at channel close according to the final close transactions submitted.
Created by I.  Jointly controlled by I and R while the channel is open.
Control is returned to I at close.

- V, the _reserve account_, that holds an amount of native asset contributed
by R that will be used to sponsor the claimable balance ledger entries
created at disbursement.  Created by R.  Jointly controlled by I and R while
the channel is open.  Control is returned to R at close.  Cannot be merged
until all claimable balances created at close for R are claimed by R.

### Constants

The two participants agree on the following constants:

- m, the _maximum transaction count for an iteration's transaction set_, is
defined as 2, the maximum number of transactions that can be signed in any
process between the increments of iteration number i.

### Variables

The two participants maintain the following variables during the lifetime of
the channel:

- s, the _starting sequence number_, is initialized to one greater than the
sequence number of escrow account E after E has been created. It is the first
available sequence number for iterations to consume.

- i, the _iteration number_, is initialized to zero.  It is incremented with
every off-chain update of the payment channel state, or on-chain setup, deposit,
withdrawal, etc.

- e, the _executed iteration number_, is initialized to zero. It is updated to
the most recent iteration number i that the participants agree to execute
on-chain, such as a setup, deposit, or withdrawal.

### Computed Values

The two participants frequently use the following computed values:

- s_i, the _iteration sequence number_, is the sequence number that iteration
i's transaction set starts at. Assuming the history of the payment channel has a
single value for m it is computable as, s+(m*i).

- s_e, the _executed iteration sequence number_, is the sequence number that the
executed iteration e's transaction set starts at. Assuming the history of the
payment channel has a single value for m it is computable as, s+(m*e).

### Processes

#### Setup

To setup the payment channel:

1. I creates the escrow account E.
2. R creates the reserve account V.
3. Set variable initial states:
   - s to E's sequence number + 1.
   - i to 0.
   - e to 0.
5. I and R build the formation transaction F.
6. Increment i.
7. Sign and exchange a closing transaction C_i, that closes the channel with
disbursements matching the initial contributions.
8. Sign and exchange a declaration transaction D_i.
9. I and R sign and exchange signatures for formation transaction F.
10. I or R submit F.

It is important that F is signed after C_i and D_i because F will make the
accounts E and V 2-of-2 multisig. Without C_i and D_i, I and R would not be able
to close the channel, or regain control of the accounts, and the assets within
without coordinating with each other.

The transactions are constructed as follows:

- F, the _formation transaction_, deposits I and R's contributions to escrow
account E, R's reserves to reserve account V, and changes escrow account E and
reserve account V to be 2-of-2 multisig accounts. F has source account E, and
sequence number set to s_i.

  F contains operations:

  - Operations sponsored by I:
    - One `BEGIN_SPONSORING_FUTURE_RESERVES` operation that specifies participant
    I as a sponsor of future reserves.
    - One or more `SET_OPTIONS` operations adjusting escrow account E's
    thresholds such that I and R's signers must both sign, and adding I's
    signers to E.
    - One or more `SET_OPTIONS` operations adding I's signers to V.
    - One or more `CHANGE_TRUST` operations adding trustlines to E.
    - One `END_SPONSORING_FUTURE_RESERVES` operation that stops I sponsoring
    future reserves of subsequent operations.
  - Operations sponsored by R:
    - One `BEGIN_SPONSORING_FUTURE_RESERVES` operation that specifies reserve
    account R as a sponsor of future reserves.
    - One or more `SET_OPTIONS` operations adjusting escrow account V's
    thresholds such that R and I's signers must both sign, and adding R's
    signers to V.
    - One or more `SET_OPTIONS` operations adding R's signers to E.
    - One `END_SPONSORING_FUTURE_RESERVES` operation that stops R sponsoring
    future reserves of subsequent operations.
  - One or more `PAYMENT` operations depositing I's contribution to E.
  - One or more `PAYMENT` operations depositing R's contribution to E.
  - One or more `PAYMENT` operations depositing R's reserves to V, for each
  trustline on E that will be used to sponsor claimable balances at
  disbursement.
  
- C_i, see [Update](#Update) process.

- D_i, see [Update](#Update) process.

#### Update

Participants use the update process to agree, and re-agree, on a new final state
for the channel. Participants will agree on a new final state when making
payments to one another within the channel.

For example, if the channel initial state is $30 of which $10 belongs to I and
$20 belongs to R, the first closing transaction will disburse $10 to I and $20
to R. If I makes a payment of $2 to R, this update process will involve I and R
agreeing on a new declaration and aclosing transaction that supersedes all
previous declaration and closing transaction and that will disburse $8 to I and
$22 to R.

To update the payment channel state, the participants:

1. Increment i.
2. Sign and exchange a closing transaction C_i.
3. Sign and exchange a declaration transaction D_i.

It is important that D_i is signed after C_i because D_i will invalidate any
previously signed C_i. If I and R signed and exchanged D_i first either party
could prevent the channel from closing without coordination by submitting D_i
and refusing to sign C_i.  The participants would not be able to close the
channel, or regain control of the accounts, and the assets within without
coordinating with each other.

The transactions are constructed as follows:

- C_i, the _closing transaction_, disburses funds to R and changes the signing
weights on E such that I unilaterally controls E.  C_i has source account E,
sequence number s_i+1, a `minSeqAge` of O (the observation period time
duration), and a `minSeqLedgerGap` of O (the observation period ledger count).

  The `minSeqAge` and `minSeqLedgerGap` prevents a misbehaving party from
  executing C_i when the channel state has already progressed to a later
  iteration number, as the other party has the period O to invalidate C_i by
  submitting D_i' for some i' > i.
  
  C_i contains operations:
  - One `BEGIN_SPONSORING_FUTURE_RESERVES` operation that specifies reserve
  account V as a sponsor of future reserves.
  - One `CREATE_CLAIMABLE_BALANCE` operation for each trustline that is
  disbursing funds to R.
  - One `END_SPONSORING_FUTURE_RESERVES` operation that confirms reserve
  account V's sponsorship.
  - One or more `SET_OPTIONS` operation adjusting escrow account E's
  thresholds to give I full control of E, and removing R's signers.
  - One or more `SET_OPTIONS` operation adjusting reserve account E's
  thresholds to give R full control of V, and removing I's signers.

- D_i, the _declaration transaction_, declares an intent to execute the
corresponding closing transaction C_i.  D_i has source account E, sequence
number s_i, and `minSeqNum` set to s_e.  Hence, D_i can execute at any time, so
long as E's sequence number n satisfies s_e <= n < s_i.  Because C_i has source
account E and sequence number s_i+1, D_i leaves E in a state where C_i can
execute.

  D_i does not require any operations, but since Stellar disallows empty
  transactions, it contains a `BUMP_SEQUENCE` operation with sequence value 0
  as a no-op.

#### Coordinated Close

Participants can agree to close the channel immediately by modifying and
resigning the most recently signed confirmation transaction. The participants
change `minSeqAge` and `minSeqLedgerGap` to zero.

1. Submit most recent D_i
2. Modify the most recent C_i `minSeqAge` and `minSeqLedgerGap` to zero
3. Resign and exchange the modified confirmation transaction C_i
4. Submit modified C_i

#### Uncoordinated Close

Participants can close the channel after the observation period O without
coordinating. They do this by submitting the most recently signed declaration
transaction, waiting the observation period O, then submitting the closing
transaction.

1. Submit most recent D_i
2. Wait observation period O
3. Submit C_i

#### Contesting a Close

Participants can contest a close if the close is not the most recent agreed
closing state of the payment channel.

Participants can attempt to close the channel at a state that is earlier in the
history of the channel than the most recently agreed to state. A participant who
is a malicious actor might attempt to do this if an earlier state benefits them.

The malicious participant can do this by performing the [Uncoordinated
Close](#Uncoordinated-Close) process with a declaration transaction that is not
the most recently signed declaration transaction.

The other participant can identify that the close process has started at an
earlier state by monitoring changes in escrow account E's sequence. If the other
participant sees the sequence number of escrow account E change to a value that
is not the most recently used s_i, they can use the following process to contest
the close. A participant contests a close by submitting a more recent
declaration transaction and closing the channel at the actual final state. A
more recent declaration transaction may be submitted because it has a higher
sequence number than the declaration transaction that the malicious actor
submitted. The more recent declaration transaction prevents the malicious actor
from submitting the older closing transaction because it has a lower sequence
number making that transaction invalid.

1. Get E's sequence number n
2. If s_{e+1} >= n < s_i, go to step 3, else go to step 1
3. Submit most recent D_i
4. Wait observation period O
5. Submit C_i

#### Changing the Channel Setup

The payment channel setup can be altered with on-chain transactions after
channel setup. Some of the operations used to alter the channel setup may fail
even if the transactions are valid, while others will always succeed if the
transactions are valid.

Some operations are implemented in a two-step process. Participants agree on a
new closing state at a future iteration by signing C_i and D_i transactions
where i has skipped an iteration that is not yet executable because the D_i's
`minSeqNum` is also set in the future. Participants then sign a transaction to
make the change that only moves the sequence of escrow account E to satisfy the
`minSeqNum` of the future D_i.

Operations that can fail and change the balances of the channel have the
following requirements as well:

- The transaction that can fail must have its source account set to an account
that is not escrow account E.
- The transaction that can fail must contain a `BUMP_SEQUENCE` operation that
bumps escrow account E's sequence number to a sequence number that makes the D_i
executable.

Operations where failure cannot occur or is of no consequence:

- [Change the Observation Period](#Change-the-Observation-Period)
- [Add Trustline](#Add-Trustline)
- [Remove Trustline](#Remove-Trustline)

Operations that can fail and where the additional requirements apply:
- [Deposit by Initiator](#Deposit-by-Initiator)
- [Deposit by Responder](#Deposit-by-Responder)
- [Withdraw](#Withdraw)

##### Add Trustline

Participants can add additional trustlines if they plan to make deposits of new balances.

1. I and R sign and exchange signatures for trustline transaction TA_i.
2. I or R submit TA_i.

If the add trustline transaction TA_i fails or is never submitted, there is
no consequence to the channel.

The transactions are constructed as follows:

- TA_i, the _add trustline transaction_, adds one or more trustlines on escrow
account E, and deposits R's reserves to reserve account V. TA_i has any source
account that is not E or V, typically the participant proposing the change.

  TA_i contains operations:

  - Operations sponsored by I:
    - One `BEGIN_SPONSORING_FUTURE_RESERVES` operation that specifies
    participant I as a sponsor of future reserves.
    - One or more `CHANGE_TRUST` operations adding trustlines to E.
    - One `END_SPONSORING_FUTURE_RESERVES` operation that stops I sponsoring
    future reserves of subsequent operations.
  - One or more `PAYMENT` operations depositing R's reserves to V, for each new
  trustline on E that will be used to sponsor claimable balances at
  disbursement.

##### Remove Trustline

Participants can remove empty trustlines.

1. I and R sign and exchange signatures for trustline transaction TR_i.
2. I or R submit TR_i.

If the remove trustline transaction TR_i fails or is never submitted, there is
no consequence to the channel.

The transactions are constructed as follows:

- TR_i, the _remove trustline transaction_, removes one or more trustline on
escrow account E, and withdraws R's reserves from reserve account V. TR_i has
any source account that is not E or V, typically the participant proposing the
change.

  TR_i contains operations:

  - Operations sponsored by I:
    - One `BEGIN_SPONSORING_FUTURE_RESERVES` operation that specifies
    participant I as a sponsor of future reserves.
    - One or more `CHANGE_TRUST` operations removing trustlines from E.
    - One `END_SPONSORING_FUTURE_RESERVES` operation that stops I sponsoring
    future reserves of subsequent operations.
  - One or more `PAYMENT` operations withdrawing R's reserves from V, for each
  trustline being removed from E that would have been used to sponsor claimable
  balances at disbursement and are no longer required.

##### Deposit by Initiator

Participant I may deposit into the channel without coordination with
participant R, as long as escrow account E already has a trustline for the
asset being deposited.

If participant I wishes to deposit an asset that escrow account E does not hold
a trustline for, the [Add Trustlines](#Add-Trustline) process must be used
first.

##### Deposit by Responder

Participant R may deposit into the channel without coordination with participant
I, as long as escrow account E already has a trustline for the asset being
deposited, and as long as participants R's intent is to make a payment of the
same value to participant I. Any amounts deposited to the payment channel
without coordination will be disbursable to participant I at close.

Participant R must coordinate with participant I to deposit any amount that it
does not intend to immediately pay participant I. The participants use the
following process:

1. Increment i.
2. I and R build the deposit transaction P_i.
3. Set e' to the value of e.
4. Set e to i.
5. Increment i.
6. Sign and exchange a closing transaction C_i, that closes the channel with
disbursements matching the most recent agreed state, but increasing R's
disbursed amount by R's deposit amount.
7. Sign and exchange a declaration transaction D_i.
8. I and R sign and exchange signatures for deposit transaction P_i.
9. I or R submit P.

If the deposit transaction P fails or is never submitted, the C_i and D_i are
not executable because escrow account E's sequence number was not bumped to s_i.
The participants should take the following steps since the deposit did not
succeed:

10. Set e to the value of e'.

The transactions are constructed as follows:

- P_i, the _deposit transaction_, makes one or more payments from any Stellar
accounts to escrow account E. P_i has any source account that is not E or V,
typically the participant proposing the change.

  P_i contains operations:

  - One or more `PAYMENT` operations depositing assets into escrow account E.
  - One `BUMP_SEQUENCE` operation bumping the sequence number of escrow account
  E to s_i.
  
- C_i, see [Update](#Update) process.

- D_i, see [Update](#Update) process.

##### Withdraw

Participants must coordinate to withdraw an amount without closing the channel.
The participants use the following process, where W is the participant
withdrawing:

1. Increment i.
2. I and R build the withdrawal transaction W_i.
3. Set e' to the value of e.
4. Set e to i.
5. Increment i.
6. Sign and exchange a closing transaction C_i, that closes the channel with
disbursements matching the most recent agreed state, but reducing W's disbursed
amount by W's withdrawal amount.
7. Sign and exchange a declaration transaction D_i.
8. I and R sign and exchange signatures for withdrawal transaction W_i.
9. I or R submit W.

If the withdrawal transaction W_i fails or is never submitted, the C_i and D_i
are not executable because escrow account E's sequence number was not bumped to
s_i.  The participants should take the following steps since the withdrawal did
not succeed:

10. Set e to the value of e'.

The transactions are constructed as follows:

- W_i, the _withdrawal transaction_, makes one or more payments from the escrow
account E to any Stellar account. W_i has any source account that is not E or V,
typically the participant proposing the change.

  W_i contains operations:

  - One or more `PAYMENT` operations withdrawing assets from escrow account E.
  - One `BUMP_SEQUENCE` operation bumping the sequence number of escrow account
  E to s_i.
  
- C_i, see [Update](#Update) process.

- D_i, see [Update](#Update) process.

##### Change the Observation Period

The participants may agree at anytime to decrease period O by simply using a
smaller value for O in future transaction sets.  The change will only apply to
future transaction sets.  The change does not require submitting a transaction
to the network.

The participants may agree at anytime to increase period O by using a larger
value for O in the next and future transaction sets, or regenerating the most
recent transaction set, then signing and submitting a transaction that bumps the
sequence number of the escrow account to the sequence before the most recent
D_i. The sequence bump ensures only the most recent transaction with the new
period O is valid.

The participants:

1. Increment i.
2. I and R build the bump transaction B_i.
3. Increment i.
4. Sign and exchange a closing transaction C_i, that closes the channel with
disbursements matching the most recent agreed state.
5. Sign and exchange a declaration transaction D_i.
6. I and R sign and exchange signatures for bump transaction B_i.
7. I or R submit B_i.
9. Set e to B_i's iteration number.

The transactions are constructed as follows:

- B_i, the _bump transaction_, bumps the sequence number of escrow account E
such that only the most recent transaction set is valid. B has source account E,
sequence number s_i.

  B_i does not require any operations, but since Stellar disallows empty
  transactions, it contains a `BUMP_SEQUENCE` operation with sequence value 0 as
  a no-op.

#### Reusing a Channel

After close, escrow account E and reserve account V can be reused for another
channel with the same or different participants. The relevant account creation
steps during [Setup](#Setup) are skipped. All variable values from the closed
channel are discarded and set anew with iteration number i and executed
iteration number e being set to zero.

### Network Transaction Fees

All transaction fees are paid by the participant submitting the transaction to
the Stellar network.

All transactions defined in the protocol with escrow account E as the source
account have their fees set to zero.  The submitter of a transaction wraps the
transaction in a fee bump transaction envelope and provides an appropriate fee,
paying the fee themselves.

Credits and debits to escrow account E only ever represent deposits or
withdrawals by I or R, and the sum of all disbursements at close equal the sum
of all deposits minus the sum of all withdrawals.  Network transaction fees do
not change the balance of the channel.

### Reserves

All reserves for new ledger entries created to support the payment channel are
supplied by the participant who will be in control of the ledger entry at
channel close.  Participants should have no impact or dependence on each other
after channel close, and so they must not sponsor ledger entries that only the
other party controls after channel close, either directly or indirectly through
the escrow or reserve accounts.  For example, if the escrow account was to
sponsor the creation of claimable balances at channel close, participant I would
be unable to merge escrow account E until participant R claimed their claimable
balances.

Ledger entries that do not survive channel close, such as signers, are sponsored
by their beneficiary.  Participants pay for their own key and signing
requirements.

Participant I provides reserves for:
- Escrow account E
- Trustlines added to E
- Signers added to E for I
- Signers added to V for I

Participant R provides reserves for:
- Signers added to E for R
- Reserve account V
- Signers added to V for R
- Claimable balances created at close

The total reserves required for each participant are:

- Participant I

  - 1 (Escrow Account E)
  - \+ Number of Assets (for Trustlines)
  - \+ 2 x Number of I's Signers

- Participant R

  - 1 (Reserve Account V)
  - \+ Number of Assets (for Claimable Balances)
  - \+ 2 x Number of R's Signers

In the rare event that a network upgrade results in base reserve increasing, but
participant R does not increase the funds in reserve account V to sufficiently
cover the reserve cost, participant I may choose to deposit the amount of native
asset necessary into reserve account V themselves, at some written-off cost to
themselves.

## Security Concerns

### Transaction Signing Order

In many of the processes outlined in the protocol an order is provided to when
transactions should be signed and exchanged. This order is critical to the
protocol. If a participant signs transactions out-of-order they will allow the
other participant to place the channel into a state where disbursement is not
possible without the participants coordinating.

### Closing Transaction Failure

The closing transaction, C_i, must never fail.  Under the conditions of the
Stellar Consensus Protocol as it is defined today, and under correct use of this
protocol, there is no known conditions that will cause it to fail.  It will be
either invalid or valid and successful, but not valid and failed.  If C_i was to
be valid and fail it would consume a sequence number and fair distribution of
the assets within the escrow account would require the cooperation of all
participants.

If this protocol is not implemented correctly one condition that can result in
the closing transaction failing is if there is not sufficient native asset to
sponsor the ledger entries created by the transaction.  The closing transaction
creates one or more new claimable balance ledger entries that each require
sponsoring.  If the sponsor has insufficient native asset the closing
transaction will fail.  To avoid this situation it is critical that participants
lock sufficient funds up-front to provide the reserve, and that both
participants monitor base reserve changes in the network and respond by adding
additional native asset if required.

Another condition that can result in the closing transaction failing is if the
use of claimable balances is replaced with payment operations. Payment
operations may fail and as such a closing transaction containing a payment can
fail.

## Limitations

This protocol defines the mechanisms of the Stellar network's core protocol that
are used to enforce agreements made by two participants. This protocol does not
define the transport through which the agreements are coordinated, or the
methods through which more than two participants can coordinate and exchange
dependent agreements. These issues are likely to be discussed in separate
proposals.
