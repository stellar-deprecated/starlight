# Benchmark Report 2021-10-25

This report is a summary of the results seen on 2021-10-25 and 2021-10-26
benchmarking a Starlight payment channel. This report details the setup and how
the benchmark was run, as well as the results.

The application used for the benchmarking is the `examples/console` application
in this repository. Some aspects of the application have been optimized, but
many parts have not. As an example, participants use simple JSON where some of
the message is compressed. The results in this report should not be viewed as
the maximum possible performance possible with a Starlight payment channel.

## Summary

The test demonstrated that performance is influenced significantly by the
latency of the network connection between the payment channel participants.
However, even connections with greater latency, such as those spanning
countries, can deliver high numbers of payments per second.

The tests use a Starlight bi-directional payment channel, but only move assets
in a single direction for the duration of the test. The tests send payments
using buffering, where payments are buffered and sent in batches.

Test AB6 demonstrated over 400,000 payments per second for payments varying from
0.0000001 to 1000.0, over Internet with 10-20ms latency.

Since smaller payment amounts take up less data, higher payments per second were
observed for payments that trend towards micro-payments.

For example, test AB5 demonstrated over 700,000 payments per second for payments
varying from 0.0000001 to 1.0. And, test AB2 over 1,190,000 payments per second
with micro-payments where every payment is for 0.0000001.

Tests AC1, AC2, AC3 also demonstrated that at least 17,000 to 130,000 payments
per second is possible on networks with latency as high as 215ms.

## Participants

Three participants were involved in the tests, with a payment channel formed
between participants A and B, and also between participants A and C.

### Participant A

- Location: San Francisco, US
- Network: 1gbps
- Hardware:
   ```
   MacBook Pro (13-inch, 2019, Four Thunderbolt 3 ports)
   2.8 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i7
   16 GB 2133 MHz LPDDR3
   ```

### Participant B

- Location: San Francisco, US
- Network: ~200mbps
- Hardware:
   ```
   MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019)
   2.6 GHz 6-Core Intel Core i7
   32 GB 2667 MHz DDR4
   ```

### Participant C

- Location: Florianopolis, Brazil
- Network: 200mbps
- Hardware:
   ```
   MacBook Air (M1, 2020)
   Apple M1
   16 GB
   ```

## Setup

A preivate network running using Docker container from:
https://github.com/stellar/docker-stellar-core-horizon/tree/4d34da83d0876e21ff68cf90653053879239707b

Benchmark application in use `examples/console` from:
https://github.com/stellar/starlight/tree/f43363c6b1593134344629b32883529f494bab23

Note in both setups below no snapshots of the channel state are being written to
disk. Data persistence functionality exists in the console application and can
be enabled, but was not enabled for these tests. However, no significant
difference in performance has been witnessed with having that functionality
enabled.

### Listener

```
$ cd examples/console
$ go run -horizon=<horizon> -listen=:8001
```

### Connector

```
$ cd examples/console
$ go run -horizon=<horizon> -http=9000 -connect=<IP>:8001
> open USD
> deposit 10000000
> deposit 10000000 other
```

## Tests and Results

### Understanding the Tests

Each test sends payments in one direction on the bi-directional payment channel.
Each test specifies a max payment amount, payment count, and a maximum buffer
size in the `payx` command. i.e. `payx <maximum payment amount> <payment count>
<max buffer size>`.

For example, test AB6 `payx 1000 1000000 50000`, sent 1 million payments, with
amounts varying from 0.0000001 to 1000.0, and it allowed payments to buffer into
batches holding up to 50k payments.

Payments are buffered until the channel is available to propose the next
agreement. An agreement is then built containing one or more buffered payments.
The agreement containing a list of all buffered payments are transmitted to the
recipient, and back again in full.

Agreements TPS is the number of agreements per second that the participants have
signed and exchanged. Agreements are transmitted across the wire and so the
agreements TPS is limited by the patency of both participants and their
capability to quickly produce ed25519 signatures for the two transactions that
form each agreement. Agreements TPS is limited by the latency between both
participants. For example, if the participants have a ping time of 30ms, the
highest agreements TPS value possible will be 1s/30ms=33tps. Or if the
participants have a ping time of 200ms, the highest agreements TPS value
possible will be 1s/200ms=5tps.

Buffered payments TPS is the number of buffered payments per second that the
participants have exchanged inside agreements. Buffered payments are transmitted
across the wire inside an agreement. The maximum buffer size is the maximum
number of payments that will be transmitted in a single agreement. Buffered
payments TPS are limited by the bandwidth and latency between both participants.

Buffered payments average buffer size is the average size in bytes of the
buffers that were transmitted between participants.
